Last updated: December 7, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using TypeWriterPro (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using TypeWriterPro, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. The Service is provided subject to applicable laws and regulations.

## 2. Service Description

TypeWriterPro is a lightweight web-based writing and markdown editor that provides a rich text/markdown editing experience and optional cloud saving features (e.g., Save to Google Drive) to store documents you create.

## 3. User Accounts and OAuth

- Some features (e.g., Save to Google Drive) require signing in with a Google account via OAuth. When you grant access via OAuth, you authorize the Service to access the specific Google Drive files and metadata described in the consent prompt.
- You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure. If you suspect unauthorized access to your Google account, contact Google immediately.

## 4. User Content

- You retain ownership of any content you create, upload, or store using the Service.
- By using Save to Google Drive or similar features, you grant TypeWriterPro permission to access and modify the files you choose to save to your own cloud storage for the limited purpose of providing the Service.
- You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, and permissions to submit the content you upload or save.

## 5. Prohibited Use

You agree not to use the Service to upload, post, or transmit content that:

- Violates applicable laws or regulations
- Infringes intellectual property rights
- Is unlawful, harmful, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable

The Service reserves the right to remove content that violates these Terms.

## 6. Intellectual Property

- The Service and its original content (excluding User Content) are and will remain the exclusive property of TypeWriterPro or its licensors.
- The project may be distributed under an open-source license (see `LICENSE`) or a proprietary license (`PROPRIETARY_LICENSE`) depending on the repository files. Check the repository root for the applicable license.

## 7. Privacy and Data Security

- Our privacy practices are described in the Privacy Policy (`privacy-policy.md`). By using the Service you agree to the data practices described there.
- For production deployments, the operator should enable HTTPS and secure server-side storage for OAuth tokens. Demo or sample deployments may store tokens in memory only.

## 8. Disclaimers

- THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
- We do not guarantee uninterrupted access or error-free operation.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

- TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TYPEWRITERPRO, ITS DEVELOPERS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TypeWriterPro and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 11. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, and without prior notice. Upon termination, any access tokens issued to the app will no longer be usable.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the project owner or operator resides. If you are using this project on behalf of an organization, the organization's local laws may apply.

## 13. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. The updated version will be posted in `terms-of-service.md` with a revised "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.
